# 100DaysOfAlgorithmicProgramming
Here I will be  posting my solution to the problems on various competitive websites.

I'll post the problem with some of it's test cases for better understanding.
I'll be posting my solution with my time and Space complexity

I'll be using C++ or Java or Python whichever convenient as my prgramming language.

ANYWAYS I will be happy if you provide a  better solution or a solution with  better time and space complexity so kindly ***FORK*** this repo and make the required changes. 
Post the changes send me a ***PULL REQUEST***
I'll be ***HAPPY TO MERGE*** it into master  if you got a nice and clever solution.
